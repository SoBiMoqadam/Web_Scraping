# Web_Scraping_Withpython
Hi, this is an automation scraper code sample that uses the selenium library and can also use the bs4 beautiful library which is faster and then this code extracts the site information specified in the code 
including ISBN, price and number of pages of the book. When the extraction is complete, it saves it in a csv, json and excel file.
